# Final-Project-TFA

A description of what has been implemented:
    1. In a first Jupyter notebook called Top10.ipynb, we analyzed what the top 10 causes of calls to 311 are in  chosen ZIP code 11101, and calculate how many total incidents of each of these 10 types there have been in the year 2020.
    2. In a second Jupyter notebook called Parking.ipynb, we analyzed whether illegal parking incidents are a larger fraction of total 311 incidents in the ZIP code 11101 than they are in general.
